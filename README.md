# GUESS-THE-NUMBER--js

Hello
this code is solely for the aim of learning.
comments are added to explain certain sections of code.
the code is dry and if not understood, you can ask questions via LinkedIn on Uma Olamma
you can copy the codes and create a new branch to change some of the codes and try something out. but please do not make any change to the main branch.
I use Prettier for formatting. so, you might not need to download the prettier file if you use another.
